A simple C program to predict and analyse end-sem marks of a student using linear regression 

This program can be used for two purposes
  1) To predict the end-sem marks of a student based on his mid-sem marks
  2) To analyse the performance of a student in his end-sem exam
 
  This program assumes that the performance of a student is a linear funtion of his mid-sem marks
  
  We write this as :  
 
       (marks secured by a student in end-sem) = a * (marks secured by him in mid-sem) + b 
  
  for simplicity we denote end-sem marks of a student by "y" and the mid-sem marks by "x"
 
  now the equation takes the form :
 
       y = a * x + b
  where the values a and b are calculated by performing linear regression on the training examples
